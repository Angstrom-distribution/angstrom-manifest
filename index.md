## Welcome to the √Öngstr√∂m Distribution

√Öngstr√∂m was started by a small group of people who worked on the OpenEmbedded, OpenZaurus and OpenSimpad projects to unify their effort to make a stable and userfriendly distribution for embedded devices like handhelds, set top boxes and network-attached storage devices and more.

Our name is **√Öngstr√∂m**, not **OpenEmbedded √Öngstr√∂m**. While √Öngstr√∂m is currently using OpenEmbedded heavily through the Yocto Project it isn‚Äôt including it in its name. So if you send out a press-release, please use the proper name.

√Öngstr√∂m is versatile, it scales down to devices with 4MB of flash to devices with terabytes of RAID storage. Someday it might even run on a toaster üôÇ
